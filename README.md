# AWS Alien Attack Workshop

Welcome to the AWS Alien Attack workshop (beta version).   

The purpose of AWS Alien Attack is to create a fun environment where you can taste and think about different aspects of serverless architectures for (near) real-time ingesting and processing of data at AWS. You can use Alien Attack to think, exercise, and talk about best practices for development, about security, databases and so on.

<details><summary>
AWS Alien Attack runs very close at zero-cost for one user, but there is cost. Check more details about the services/products used in this list.</summary>

* **CDK**: AWS Alien Attack was built using CDK for the infrastructure deployment. To know more about CDK, check [what is CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/CDK/latest/userguide/what-is.html), and visit its [github repository](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-cdk). Also, take some time to explore this [workshop](https://cdkworkshop.com/).
* **Cloud9**: Cloud9 it will be your "development environment". To know more about Cloud9, including pricing, click [here](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/). Cloud9 provides free tier.
* **Amazon Cognito**: Cognito is the service that we are using to provide identification and authentication services to AWS Alien Attack. To know more about Cognito, including pricing, click [here](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/). Cognito provides free tier.
* **Amazon Identity and Access Management (IAM)**: IAM is a service that allows ytou to create and manage acess to AWS resources, and for Alien Attack we are using roles and polices alongside Cognito to provide the proper authorizations to the users. So, with Cognito and IAM, we cover identification, authentication, and authorization using RBAC (Role-Based Access Control). To learn more about IAM, go [here](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/). IAM is free.
* **Amazon S3**: S3 is used to host the website and to store the raw incoming data for analytics purposes. Read more about it [here](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). S3 provides free tier.
* **Amazon API Gateway**: API Gateway will be the interface between the gamer and the back-end. To know more about it, go [here](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/). API Gateway provides free tier.
* **AWS Lambda**: Lambda is the foundation for our processing layer. It allows you to run code without having to provision servers. To know more about it go [here](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/). Lambda provides free tier.
* **Amazon Kinesis Data Stream**: Is the service that we use for ingesting streaming data. To know more about Kinesis Data Stream, including pricing, click [here](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-streams/). Kinesis Data Streams *has not free tier* , but the cost for this application, for 1 user, the cost associated to Kinesis Data Streams it will be of 1 cent per hour approximately.
* **Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose**: Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose is the easiest way to load streaming data into data stores and analytics tools. It can capture, transform, and load streaming data into Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, Amazon Elasticsearch Service, and Splunk, enabling near real-time analytics with existing business intelligence tools and dashboards youâ€™re already using today.  We are using it to drop data from Kinesis Data Streams to To know more about Kinesis Data Firehose, including pricing, click [here](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-firehose/). Kinesis Data Firehose *has not free tier* , but the cost for testing this application will be neglectable. Check the pricing model to learn more.
* **Amazon DynamoDB**: Is the database that we are using to store the scoreboard data for the game sessions. Amazon DynamoDB is s a key-value and document database that delivers single-digit millisecond performance at any scale. It's a fully managed, multiregion, multimaster database with built-in security, backup and restore, and in-memory caching for internet-scale applications. DynamoDB can handle more than 10 trillion requests per day and support peaks of more than 20 million requests per second. DynamoDB provides free tier, and we will be running under it for Alien Attack. To learn more about it, visit [this link](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/).
* **AWS Systems Manager**: Systems Manager provides a unified user interface so you can view operational data from multiple AWS services and allows you to automate operational tasks across your AWS resources. We are using the [Parameter Store](https://aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/features/#Parameter_Store) feature of Systems Manager, which provides a centralized store to manage your configuration data, whether plain-text data such as database strings or secrets such as passwords. To know more about Systems Manager, including pricing, click [here](https://aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/).  Parameter store is free.
* At the *programming* side, we are using [AWS SDK for Javascript in the Browser](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-browser/) and [AWS SDK for node](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-node-js/). Alien Attack was not developed using the best practices, exaclty because one of the workshops is about fixing it and applying the best practices for programming and DevSecOps.

### Background story

*UnicornGames* is a company focused in designing games for entertainment and in implementing gamefication strategies for companies over different contexts, like sales tracking, investment performance tracking, and more.

We just bought the Alien Attack Unit from UnicornGames. Alien Attack seems to be only a simple game, but under the hood it is a near real-time application (NRTA) that computes scores from an incoming stream of data, and we want to leverage it for other purposes. 

The Chief Development Engineer at the Alien Attack Unit of UnicornGames is not happy by being acquired. He was expecting to become a VP and to buy part of the company. With our acquisition, he mutinied and left the company, taking some of the lead SDEs with him, and leaving us with with a broken code that we need to fix before an upcoming presentation that we are going to do to our executives.

We were able to recover some instructions that we believe will help us to deploy the broken environment, and fix it timely for the C-level demo.

One of the recovered assets is the architecture. Additional information you will find by following the instructions.

![Markdown preferences pane](./images/alienattack.architecture.png)

We hope that your skills may help us with the challenge of *MAKING THE APPLICATION TO WORK*.


# Instructions

## Preparing the environment

### prepACTIVITY 1 - Cloud9 - Create your environment

#### STEP 1 - Access your account
1. Login to your account
2. Select a region (take note of the region) - We recommend us-east-1 (Virginia) or us-east-2 (Ohio)

**IMPORTANT:** Be sure that you have permissions to create resources on your account. For the purpose of this workshop, having administrative privileges is the best option.

#### STEP 2 - Launch your Cloud9 environment
1. On the AWS console, go to Cloud9. 
	* Go to the Cloud9 section of the console
	* Select **Create environment**
	* Give a name to your environment. **Important:** If you are sharing the same account and region with a colleague, be sure to take note of the identification of your environment, and be careful to not to destroy your colleague environment.
	* For the "environment settings":
		* For "Environment type" choose `Create a new instance for environment (EC2)`
		* For "Instance type" choose `t2.micro (1 GiB RAM + 1 vCPU)*`
		* Leave the other configuration settings at their default values and click **Next step**, and then **Create environment**

In a few seconds your environment will be available. You can close the Welcome tab.

#### <a name="config-cloneapprep"></a>STEP 3 - Clone this repository

At the bottom of the Cloud9 console a terminal is available. Go to the terminal and clone this repository. This repository contains the back-end.

~~~
~/environment $ git clone https://github.com/fabianmartins/alienattack.workshop
~~~

#### STEP 4 - Clone the application repository - ON YOUR COMPUTER

**This is supposed to be done on your local computer**. You can clone it at your Cloud9 environment, but for having a better experience, using your favorite browser, clone it in your own computer.

This is the repository with the Alien Attack front end.

**IMPORTANT:** Disregard any instructions at that repository (but you can always read the comments).

~~~
 git clone https://github.com/fabianmartins/alienattack.application.git
~~~

**IMPORTANT:** The frond-end DOES NOT WORK YET on mobile devices, and in some versions of Windows, especially those with touch screen.


#### STEP 5 - Update the environment - at Cloud9

Getting back to your **Cloud9 environment**, run the script `config.sh` following the instructions below.

Running this script will update your environment. This script changes your bash_profile. So, if your intend to run it on your own machine, be sure about the side effects of this action.

~~~
~/environment $ cd alienattack.workshop
~/environment/alienattack.workshop/ (master) $ source config.sh
~~~

Don't worry if some *warning* messages appear, especially if it's about python.

To check if everything is ok, you can run the following commands:

~~~
node --version
~~~
This will show you the latest version, which you can compare to the results of  

~~~
nvm ls-remote --lts | grep Latest
~~~
which will give you the list of long-term supported (lts) versions.

And by running 

~~~
cdk
~~~

and getting a non-error response, you will be sure that CDK (Cloud Development Kit) is working.

#### STEP 6 - Start background compilation for CDK

There are two ways of building the environment: *continuously*, and *on demand*. 

*On demand* is done by running `npm run build` from inside the cdk folder at each time you change a .ts (typescript) file. This is not very operational, so we will stick to *continuous compilation*.

*Continuous compilation*, the recommended approach, means that the environment will be automatically compiled at every file change, so you can check possible errors right away.

One way of configuring continuous compilation is by having 2 terminals open. One you will be using to issue commands. The other one, you will be using to monitor the progress of the development and corresponding compilation.

*Do this:*

1. At the bottom of the page of your Cloud9 IDE, click the **`(+)`** icon, and then `New Terminal` to add a second terminal.
2. On the new terminal, get into the cdk folder and run `npm run watch`:

~~~ 
~/environment $ cd alienattack.workshop/cdk/
~/environment/alienattack.workshop/cdk (master) $ npm run watch
~~~ 

This will kick off the continuous compilation of the environment. It may take a few seconds until you get the results. 

The output may come out perfectly with 0 errors, or with some errors. If these errors are of the type TS6192 or TS6133, then you're good. These errors appear when some classes are imported but not used, like when part of the code is commented. This will not break the code at the running time.

A totally successful compilation will be something like the output below:

~~~ 
~/environment/alienattack.workshop/cdk (master) $ npm run watch

[0:00:00 AM] Starting compilation in watch mode...


[0:00:00 AM] Found 0 errors. Watching for file changes.
~~~  

**IMPORTANT:** If you decide for not using the continuous compilation, you must remember to run `npm run build` every time you save a file.


#### STEP 7 - Synthesize the cloudformation for your environment

You will need to decide for an **"Environment name"** that will be used to configure and deploy your environment. 

**My suggestions for you:**  
 
* **DON'T** use special characters, dashes, spaces in the environment name.
* **DON'T** use long names like *ThisIsMyEnvironmentName*, or *ThisIsAnUnecessaryVeryLongAndName*. Keep it simple. User something like Env01.
* Also, **DON'T** use very short names, like *fm*. Try to use at least 5 characters to avoid name collisions.
* If you're alone in the account/region, pick a small word for envname, like your initials, and add the month and day just to avoid collisions (ex: fabi0405).
* The environment name will be used to create new S3 buckets. S3 bucket names are global. So, if you use very common words (like test, dev, prod, system, app) almost surely you will get a name collision. Be sure of chosing something that will avoid this kind of issue.
* Avoid using potentially reserved words. Possible reserved words are AWS, S3, and so on.

The configuration was designed like this for the case when different individuals are sharing the same account (due their company's requirements) and sharing the same region (due the need of specific features of the AWS services, only available in such regions).

Yet, the value chosen for **"envname"** is used to create the buckets required by the application, so chose them in a way that most likely will avoid collision to S3 bucket names (which are global).

Let's suppose that you selected envname=r2d2. Then, if the deployment is successful, at the end something like this will appear

***

 âœ…  R2D2

Stack ARN:
arn:aws:cloudformation:<region>:<account>:stack/R2D2/bc543b91-451f-33f9-442a-02e473ddfb1a

And the deployment will have created the buckets **r2d2.app** and **r2d2.raw**.

if the deployment WAS NOT SUCCESSFUL, then almost surely you had a S3 bucket name collision. if the message is similar to the one below, then chose another envname for your deployment. In the example below, the name TEST for the environment provokes a collision:

~~~

***

#### Step 7.1 - Synthetizing your environment

1. Go to the other available terminal at your Cloud9 environment and be sure of being at the CDK folder
2. Use the synth command for CDK to synthetize your enviroment.

~~~
~/environment/alienattack.workshop/cdk (master) $
~/environment/alienattack.workshop/cdk (master) $ cdk synth -c envname=<envname>
~~~

This will generate an output for the corresponding Cloudformation template. You can save it by redirecting the result to some folder, so you can read it through.


#### Step 7.2 - Deploy your backend

Being at your cdk folder, and having decided for an *envname*, run the following command:

~~~
~/environment/alienattack.workshop/cdk (master) $ cdk deploy -c envname=<envname>
~~~

CDK will first to show you what changes will be applied to the environment. After that, it will ask if you really want to deploy.

Answer with **y**, and wait for environment to be deployed.

Wait for the environment finishing deploying.

## Fix the application

Here is where we start fixing the environment.

The system is comprised of two applications: the Game, and the Scoreboard.

We know that the system is not running properly because we tried to run each one of the applications, and while having the browser console opened, we could see a lot of errors, and it's clear that the application is broken.

As you will need to run the application after fixing it (or now, just to check if it's really broken), here is the guidance for opening each one of the applications. 

For this part, you will use the environment that you cloned **into your local computer** on the step ["Clone the application repository - ON YOUR COMPUTER"](#config-cloneapprep).

* **Manager console**: using your browser, visit the folder where you installed the application, and open **`./scoreboard/index.html`**.
* **Game console**: using your browser, visit the folder where you installed the application, and open **`./game/index.html`**.

As it is not running, let's try to fix it using the following instructions.

### fixACTIVITY 1 - Application - Fix the application configuration

We got a tip from one of the developers that remained at the company that a config file is an important part of the application, and without being properly configured, the application will not run.

##### [Problem] 
The config file for the downloaded application is invalid.

##### [Solution guidance]
On your **local machine**, where you cloned the application, open the file `resources/js/awsconfig.js` and change it to have the following format

~~~
const DEBUG = true;
const AWS_CONFIG = {
    "region" : "<region where the env is deployed>",
    "API_ENDPOINT" : "<API Gateway invoke URL>/v1/",
    "APPNAME" : "<name of the application>"
}
~~~

Here is how to do it:

1. **region**: To find the region is easy. Probably you still remember it, or you can get it from the last message of the CDK deployment. Optionally, you can go to your console and check the URL. It will be like `https://<region>.console.aws.amazon.com`. 
2. **API_ENDPOINT**
  * Go to the AWS console, in the region that you deployed the environment, and then go to the service *API Gateway*. You will find an API with the name beginning with the name that you provided at the time of the deployment. Click on it.  
  		* From Cloud9, to open another window for the AWS console, just go to the meny and click on *AWS Cloud9* --> *Go To Your Dashboard*, and then *Services* --> *API Gateway*. You will find your API there.
  * Click on **Stages**.
  * Click on **prod**.
  * At the top of the screen, on the right, you will see the **INVOKE URL**. It has the format `https://<API Id>.execute-api.<region>.amazonaws.com/prod`. When copying it to the required field in the awsconfig.js, don't forget to add the */v1/* at the end.
3. **APPNAME**: This one is easy. Just copy the values that you selected for *envName*, **BUT MAKE SURE TO USE UPPERCASE**. So, for instance, if you selected *r2d2* for envName, then the value for this field will be *R2D2*.

If you did everything correclty, your aws_config.js file will be similar to this:

~~~
const DEBUG = true;
const AWS_CONFIG = {
    "region" : "us-east-1",
    "API_ENDPOINT" : " https://x22cd4aa99.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/v1/",
    "APPNAME" : "R2D2"
}
~~~ 

**IMPORTANT**  

* Be sure of saving the file using UTF-8 (pure text). Avoid editors that save the files with special characters
* Don't forget to maintain the quotes that are on those fields. 
  * For example, if you are in us-east-1, the line for the region will be `"region" : "us-east-1"`. See, the quotes are there
* Be sure of using **uppercase** for the value of the field APPNAME. So, for example, if your environment name is r2d2, the line for appName will become `"APPNAME" : "R2D2"`. 
* Again, check if the quotes are there!
* Save the file!


### fixACTIVITY 2 - Test the registration process

Now, probably the application must be running, at least in part. Let's try to create an user.

These steps are going to be executed using the respository that you cloned **to your local computer**.

1. Confirm that you executed the Fix Activity 1. The file `./resources/js/aws_config.js` must be properly configured.
2. Open a privacy/incognito page for your browser. This will guarantee that you will have the cookies cleared after use.
3. Open this file that is on your application deployment: `./game/index.html`
4. If everything was ok, and the application was able to retrieve the configurations, you will see a page with the buttons `Register` and `Login`. Choose **Register**.
5. Register yourself filling the fields properly
	* **Username**: Define a username. Use only lowercase letters and don't use symbols.
	* **e-mail**: You will need a valid and accessible email. Cognito needs to send you a confirmation email and you will need to click on it to confirm. We recommend using a personal email to not get into anti-spam controls.
	* **Password**: For testing purposes, use a simple password (like `abc123`). This password is managed by Cognito. So, it's not stored on any application database.
	* **Confirm (and memorize, or take note) your password**: Repeat your password.
	* **Your company's web domain (ex: aws.amazon.com)**: Input your company domain.
	* Click on the button **Register**.
6. If everything went well, you will receive a confirmation on your email. Open the email and click on the link.

### fixACTIVITY 3 - Test the login process

1. Get back to the application on your browser (the one that you opened from `./game/index.html`), and now choose **Login** (or skip to step 2 if you're already there).
2. Enter your credentials, and click on **Login**.
3. If you entered your credentials right, you will see a pop-up message `Login successful to user <username>`.
4. If you get to a page where the indicating status is WAITING and a countdown stopped at 10, then the login is ok, but something else is wrong (you can check the browser console, if you want).
5. Close the window, to be sure that the cookies were deleted, so we can proceed with the test.

### fixACTIVITY 4 - Test the Alien Attack manager console

The manager console is where the manager creates a game session, and starts the game so the other participants can join it.

We've been said that these applications are needing a face lifting. However, let's leave the cosmetics for another opportunity.

**These steps are going to be executed using the respository that you cloned to your local computer.**

1. Open a privacy/incognito page for your browser. This will guarantee that you will have the cookies cleared after use.
2. Open this file that is on your application deployment: `./scoreboard/index.html`.
3. The page will show some fields for you to enter the username and password that you defined earlier. Do it.
4. If the application indicates `AccessDeniedException`, then we have an access problem. Proceed to the next fixActivity to keep on fixing the system.


### fixACTIVITY 5 - Cognito - Fix the permissions on the groups for RBAC

The people from the Security Team that joined our task force to solve the issues said that is essential to have RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) properly configured on the system. They also said that the version of the CDK used here doesn't allow us to solve that by code, unless we create a Custom Resource as it was done for the creation of the User Pool. Nobody on the team knows how to do it, and we don't have time to dive deep on it now. 

But one of the SysAdmins said to have the playbook for that, and send us the guidance. Let's try to leverage it.

##### [Problem] 
The Identity Pool configuration is missing the configuration of the roles for each one of the groups (Managers and Players). We need to attach the proper roles to the user when the user signs in to the application.

##### [Solution guidance]

This is the playbook that we've got from

1. On your AWS Console, visit the Cognito service page.
2. If you got to the landing page of the service, you will click on the button **Manage Identity Pools**.
3. You will see an Identity Pool named as `<envName>`. Click on it.
4. On the top right, there is a very discreet label entitled `Edit Identity Pool`. Click on it.
5. Open the section `Authentication Providers`.
6. Click on the tab `Cognito` just to be sure that you have it selected.
7.  On the section `Authenticated role selection` there is a select button labeled as `Use default role`. Click on this button and select **Choose role with rules**. We will create two rules.
8. First rule - **MANAGERS**
	* For the field `Claim`, input the value **cognito:preferred_role**.
	* For the drop down box at the right side of the field, select the value **Contains**.
	* For the input box at the right of the `Contains` box, input the value **`<envName>ManagersRole`**. Be careful with typos, and use uppercase for the *`<envName>`* part.
	* For the drop down box on the right, select **`<envName>ManagersRole`**.
9. Second rule - **PLAYERS**
	* For the field `Claim`, input the value **cognito:preferred_role**.
	* For the drop down box at the right side of the field, leave the value **Contains** selected.
	* For the input box at the right of the `Contains` box, input the value **`<envName>PlayersRole`**. Be careful with typos, and use uppercase for the *`<envName>`* part.
	* For the drop down box on the right, select **`<envName>PlayersRole`**.
10. **Role resolution**: Select **`Deny`**
11. Double check everything for typos, especially the fields *"Claim"* and *"Role"*
11. Leave everything else as it is and click on **`Save changes`**

**-- FastFix --**  
The fast fix for this step requires a series of steps. All of these steps where condensed into the file `fixcognito.sh` which is inside the folder `~/environment/alienattack.workshop`. Go to that folder, and run the following command:

~~~
source fixcognito.sh <envname>
~~~

### fixACTIVITY 6 - Testing the accesses again

#### Step 1 - Testing again the login to the game
Execute again the ***fixACTIVITY 3***. We've been said that it still will not work. Please confirm that this is the outcome of the test.

#### Step 2 - Testing again the login to the manager console
Execute again the ***fixACTIVITY 4***. We've been said that we are getting an AccessDeniedException. 

Let's proceed to the next activity and check if we can solve it.


### fixACTIVITY 7 - Cognito - Configure yourself as a manager

We have found some notes in the desk of the solutions architect. There is a piece of paper where is written *"use AWS CLI to make yourself an application admin"*. The following steps were found that paper. Hopefully they will help you to solve the issue.

**Task 1.** Take note of the USER POOL ID  

1. Visit your AWS console, and go to Cognito
2. Click on **Manager User Pools**
3. Click on the user pool that has the same name as the one that you defined for your application (`envName`)
4. Take note of the *Pool Id* (or copy it to a helper text file)

**Task 2.** Use AWS CLI to include your username into the Managers group  

1. Go to the terminal of your Cloud9 environment - or on your computer, with AWS CLI credentials properly configured with administrative permissions.
2. Run the command below. The command will add you to the group *Managers*, which will give you access to the Scoreboard Manager resources
3. Get back to the manager console, and try access it again

~~~
$ aws cognito-idp admin-add-user-to-group --user-pool-id <userpoolid> --username <username that you used to register> --group-name Managers --region <region>
~~~

**-- FastFix --**   
There is another way of solving this at the AWS Console. Go to Cognito, visit User Pools, click on `Users and groups`, and check the group Managers. You can add and remove users from there. 


**IMPORTANT**: This is another action that we DON'T WANT to be executed by hand. How to fix this? How to make the deployment of the environment to create an admin user automatically? Think about it. We will need it in another fixing workshop.

After fixing this, try to login to the manager console again (*fixActivity 4*). If you get a **ParameterNotFound: null**, then proceed to the next activity. It will solve it, we believe.


### fixACTIVITY 8 - Systems Manager - Create the missing parameter

One of the Systems Administrators took a look at the environment, and he said that a parameter missing on the back-end. He said that we need to fix Systems Manager. Go to the Systems Manager console, and create the parameter as specified below.

##### [Problem] 
It seems that a *'session'* parameter is missing, and this is making the application to break. 

This parameter holds the game session configuration. Every time when the Manager creates a new session, or closes it, it's updated. The parameter must exist on the back-end. We need to create it.

##### [Solution guidance]
1. On the AWS Console, go to Systems Manager.
2. Scroll down to the section *Shared Resources*, and click on `Parameter Store`. You will see some parameters starting with `/<envName>/`, but there is no parameter `/<envName>/session`. Let's create it.
3. On the top right of the page, click on **Create parameter**
4. On the section *Parameter details*, enter the following values:  
  * Name: `/<envName>/session`
  * Description: `Existing session (opened or closed)`
  * Type: `String`
  * Value:  `null` (insert the word *null*).
5. Scroll down and click on **Create parameter**

If everything went well, you will get the message *Create parameter request succeeded*. Check if the parameter exists on the list of parameters.

If you want to skip this activity: 

1. Go your CDK project (the one that it's at Cloud9), search for *MISSING PARAMETER* on all .ts (typescript) files, and follow the guidances to adjust the code.
2. Save everything and run **`cdk diff -c envname=<envName>`** at the terminal. This will show you what will be changed on your environment
3. If you agree with the changes, run **`cdk deploy -c envname=<envName>`** to deploy the changes

After fixing this, try to login to the manager console again (*fixActivity 4*). You will be forwarded to the configuration page. The access seems to be ok. 

But, **DON'T TRY TO PLAY YET**. 

In accordance to some notes found, there are other pieces to be fixed.


### fixACTIVITY 9 - Kinesis Streams/Lambda Integration - Integrate Lambda to Kinesis

The people from the Monitoring Team said that they have identified a failure in getting the scoreboard computed and stored on DynamoDb. Our SysAdmin is friend of one of the rebels, and he got this tip from his friend: *"Check if the Lambda Function with the name Scoreboard is integrated to Kinesis. If there is no trigger configured for the lambda function, that's the issue"*.

##### [Problem] 
The game data is ingested to the Kinesis Streams. Then, Lambda (the service) triggers a Lambda function every second, to make it consume the data from the Kinesis Streams. What happens to the consumed records depends on what is coded on the Lambda function.

We need to connect the Lambda function to Kinesis.

##### [Solution guidance]
1. Go to your AWS Console, and visit the Lambda service page.
2. Search for a function named **`<envName>ScoreboardFn`**.  
3. Click on the name of the function. You will be taken to the configuration of the lambda function.
4. Check if the information sent from the rebel is correct. On the section named *Designer* if you see a message *"Add triggers from the list on the left"*, then the rebel is right. The trigger is missing. Let's create it.
5. On the left, on the section 'Add triggers', click on **Kinesis**. A section named *Configure triggers* will appear below.
6. Configure the fields:
   * **Kinesis stream**: Select the Kinesis Data Stream attached to your environment. The name must be in the form `<envName>_InputStream`
   * **Consumer**: select *No consumer*
   * **Batch size**: insert the value *700*.
   * **Starting position**: select *Latest*.
   * Check box **Enable trigger**: leave it marked for now.
   * Click on the button **Add** at the right.
   * On the top, click on the button **Save**.

If you want to skip this activity: 

1. Go your CDK project, search for *MISSING KINESIS INTEGRATION* on all .ts files, and follow the guidances to adjust the code.
2. Save everything and run **`cdk diff -c envname=<envName>`** at the terminal. This will show you what will be changed on your environment
3. If you agree with the changes, run **`cdk deploy -c envname=<envName>`** to deploy the changes


### fixACTIVITY 10 - Kinesis Firehose - Create the missing Kinesis Firehose

The Analytics Team has complained that no data is going to their data lake staging area. They have said that Kinesis Streams drops the data to a Kinesis Firehose, and then Kinesis Firehose moves the data to a S3 bucket named with the suffix "raw" (you can check if the bucket exists).

They said *"This is pretty simple! It is just to connect the Kinesis Firehose to the Kinesis Streams. If the Kinesis Firehose doesn't exists, create one! Give us access and we can help. Or, call us if you need"*.

So, follow the tip, and if you need help, call them.

##### [Problem] 
Check if there is a Kinesis Firehose attached to the Kinesis Streams, and point to the S3 bucket. Fix it, or create it properly.

##### [Solution guidance]
1. Go to your AWS Console, and visit the page of Kinesis (don't confuse it with Kinesis Video).
2. On the service page you are expected to see the Kinesis Streams on the left, and a missing Kinesis Firehose for the application. Let's create it.
3. Under the section *'Kinesis Firehose Delivery Streams*', or by clicking on *'Data Firehose*' at the left hand side, click on the button **Create Delivery Stream**.
4. On the section *New delivery stream*, configure the fields as follows:
   * **Delivery stream name**: `<envName>Firehose`.
   * **Source**: Select the radio button *'Kinesis stream'*. 
   * Drop-down **Choose Kinesis stream**: select the stream attached to your deployment (the same one we connected to the Lambda function). Its name starts with `<envName>`.
   * Click **Next**.
   * **Record transformation**: Select *'Disabled'*.
   * **Record format conversion**: Select *'Disabled'*.
   * Click **Next**.
   * **Destination**: Click S3, even if it's already selected.
   * **S3 bucket**: Select the bucket attached to your application. The name will have the form `<envName>.raw`.
   * **S3 prefix**: Leave it blank
   * **S3 error prefix**: Leave it blank
   * Click **Next**
   * **Buffer size**: input the value *1*
   * **Buffer interval**: input the value *300*
   * **S3 compression**: Select *GZIP*
   * **S3 encryption**: Select *Disabled*
   * **Error logging**: Select *Enabled*
   * **IAM Role**: Click on the button `Create new or choose`. An IAM configuration page will open.
   		* *IAMRole*: Leave the option *Create a new IAM Role* selected.
   		* *Role Name*: `<envName>FirehoseRole`
   		* Click on the button **Allow**. You will be taken to the previous page.
   	* Click **Next**.
   	* Check the presented configuration.
   	* Click on **Create delivery stream**.

If everything went well, you will see that the delivery stream was created.

**-- FastFix --**  
If you want to skip this activity: 

1. Go your CDK project, search for *MISSING KINESIS FIREHOSE* on all .ts files, and follow the guidances to adjust the code.
2. Save everything and run **`cdk diff -c envname=<envName>`** at the terminal. This will show you what will be changed on your environment
3. If you agree with the changes, run **`cdk deploy -c envname=<envName>`** to deploy the changes


### fixACTIVITY 11 - Create a session for the game

Get back to the manager console ('scoreboard/index.html' on your local computer), and follow the steps below to create a gaming session.

1. Reload the Scoreboard console, and login again. This is just to guarantee that your token will be refreshed.
2. On the field `Session Name` input **TEST**
3. On the section `Game Type`, select **Multiple trials**
4. Click on the button **Start game**
5. If the page updates with a table containing a header with the words `Nickname`, `Score`, `Shots`, `Level`, `Lives`, then we are good.
6. Open a second browser window, and execute again the steps to login into the game. For a better experience, leave the windows opened side by side. This time, if everything went well, you will see a button labeled **JOIN session**. Click on it 

If you are able to play, **you have fixed it!**

Play a little bit. Check the scoreboard. Check the DynamoDB tables. Check the S3 buckets after some time.

### fixACTIVITY 12 - Computing the performance for the Top10 best players

One of the people from the Analytics team said that they had tested an API that allowed them to retrieve the performance of the players. They need this on-line for the top 10 best players. It seems that this is an initial part of their infrastructure to build a fraud-prevention platform.

We have tried, without any success, to find this code. We were able just to retrieve a small excerpt of the code, which we are showing below. We know that is not the full code required to implement the requirements, but this must be helpful.

So, you are going to need to implement the API from scratch, following the requirements below:

1. The resource to be added on API Gateway must have the name `topxstatistics`.
2. The resource will execute a HTTP GET, passing the querystring sessionId, which will hold the session id provided by the consumer of the API.
3. The API Gateway will be integrated to the Lambda Function that you are going to create, and that is going to compute the player's performance. The excerpt of code that we have is the one below:

~~~
const computeStatisticsForSession = function(sessionId,callback) { 
  // let's start by reading the session data from the database
  // retrieving the record attached to 'sessionId'
  readTopxDataFromDatabase(sessionId, (err,topXSessionData) => {
    if (err) callback(err);
    else {
      if (!topXSessionData.TopX) 
        // Table is empty. No data found.
        callback(null,null);
      else {
        // here we have the record from the TopX table
        let statistics = [];
        let position = 1;
        // Make the computations
        topXSessionData.TopX.forEach( (item) => {
            let itemStatistics = {};
            itemStatistics['Nickname'] = item.Nickname;
            itemStatistics['Position'] = position++;
            if (item.Shots != 0) {
              itemStatistics['Performance'] = item.Score/item.Shots;
            } else {
              if (item.Score != 0) itemStatistics['Performance'] = -1;
              else itemStatistics['Performance'] = 0;
            }
            statistics.push(itemStatistics);
        });
        callback(null,statistics);
      }
    }
  });
};
~~~

The API must be accessible only by the Manager.

We heard that something can be learned from this [link](http://partnerfactoryprogram.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/labpack/fullmicroservice/fullmicroservice.html). 


### Additional (and optional) task for deploying the front-end on the account

It was said that for a full deployment, we will need to install the application at the S3 bucket with the `<appNames>.app`. We will also need to deploy the CloudFront distribution because the S3 buckets are not public.

For this last part, we got intel from the rebels that, to solve this, two actions are necessary:

1. Copy the content of the front-end to the app bucket.
2. Go to the file `mainLayer.ts` which is on the deployment at Cloud9, search for *MISSING CLOUDFRONT DISTRIBUTION* and uncomment it at that file. The deployment it will take something around 20 minutes. Same time it will be required for the undeployment. But we are not expecting to solve this part today. We at the company believe that it was a big win to have reached to this point. Let's leave other adjustments for another sprints.

## PRICING AND LIMITS

Our executives are inexperienced with costs on AWS, and they would like to understand the rationale behind the costs of this architecture.

We learned that some arrangements were done to make this run under AWS Free Tier as much as possible, but we are not sure how much was left outside the free tier.

We know that for the current implementation:

* The payload is 120 bytes in size, in average.
* A player pushes 1 record at every 1 second.
* A player reads the TOP 10 scoreboard (`GET/scoreboard`) at every 2 seconds.
* The Manager scoreboard reads the Kinesis Data Stream at each 1.5 seconds.
* We are using provisioned capacity mode for DynamoDB.

Build a small team to work on the aspects of cost and limits of this architecture.


### Pricing Activity

So, we want you to estimate the costs for the environment - the cost per user and per interval of time (choose the most appropriate) - for the following scenarios:

1. One (1) gamer.
2. Ten (10) gamers.
3. Fifty (50) gamers.
4. One hundred (100) gamers.
5. One hundred and fifty (150) gamers.
6. Two hundred (200) gamers.

### Limits Activity

We are aware that the code has some issues. We heard that the environment is not prepared to scale the ingestion/consumption layer yet, something that we will need to solve *in another workshop*. 

So, **find the limits for this architecture considering that at this moment we will have only one (1) shard for Kinesis Data Streams**.

Tips:
- What are the limits for Kinesis Streams, for one shard?
- How the integration Lambda-Kinesis is affected if we have more users? Do we need to worry about the "batch size" for the Lambda-Kinesis integration? Or do we just need to fine tune it?
- How do we scale DynamoDB? Do we need to do something about it?


## Cleaning up the environment

### cleanACTIVITY 1 - Destroy the deployed environment

Go to the the terminal on your environment and type the following command. Be sure to be at your cdk folder.

```
~/environment/alienattack.workshop/cdk (master) $ cdk destroy -c envname=<envName>
```

If everything went well, you will receive a message like the following one: 

```
âœ…  <envName>: destroyed
```

If by any reason you don't have access anymore to the Cloud9 environment, or is unable to destroy the environment using CDK, go to CloudFormation on your AWS console, and delete the stack with "Stack Name" corresponding to your `<envName>`. Then move to the next activity.

### cleanACTIVITY 2 - Cleaning up the last resources

Everything that was created by CloudFormation was deleted, with the exception of the buckets. Additionaly, the resources that you created directly on the console were not deleted. 

Let's fix this.

1. Go to Systems Manager, then Parameter Store, and delete the parameter `<envName>/session`
2. Go to Kinesis, then Kinesis Firehose, and delete the resource that you created by hand
3. Go to IAM, and search for `<envName>`. Delete any resource configured like that. For sure the only resource will be `<envName>FirehoseRole`
4. Delete the S3 buckets `<envName>.app` and `<envName>.raw`
5. Delete your Cloud9 environment if you created it just for this workshop.

## Final activity

Celebrate! You deserve it!
